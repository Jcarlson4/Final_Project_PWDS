# Data Structures Tutorial.

Hello there! My name is Joseph Carlson. I will be demonstrating how to use various data structures within this tutorial. Those being, Queues, Sets, and Trees. Through learning more about these data structures, you will be able to deepen your knowledge about Computer Science and apply it to your daily work. 

[1-Introduction-to-Queues](introduction_to_queues.md)
[2-Introduction-to-Sets](introduction_to_sets.md)
[3-Introduction-to-Trees](introduction_to_trees.md)

Each introduction will contain a description of the data structure, simple code for you to follow to learn how to implement the data structure. An example and a small coding assignment for you to learn how for yourself how to code the data structure.
